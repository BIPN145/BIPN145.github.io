# Guide to Final Projects 

## Project Overview

You‚Äôve wrestled with the earthworm, poked the leech, illuminated the fly,  and listened to your own brain waves ‚Äî now it‚Äôs time to choose your own adventure.

Using any of the organisms and equipment we‚Äôve used in lab, design your own experiments for your final project. You‚Äôll have two full days of lab to conduct your experiments.

In addition to the equipment and chemicals we worked with during our labs, we have access to a few more chemicals and  pieces of equipment for you to use.


## Graded Components
* **Research proposal**: 1 page proposal of what you intend to do, submitted as a group
* **In-class presentation**: Group components and individual components
* **Project lab report**: Individually written, but your figures may be shared across group members.

## Project Possibilities
Below you‚Äôll find a list of final project options, sorted by model organism. If you have a well-formed idea that is not on the list, please let us know and we can discuss its feasibility.

* Caffeine (12 mM)

### Drosophila

#### Impact of Alcohol on _Drosophila _geotaxis in _eag _knockouts_  _  ü™∞ üç∫
You‚Äôll compare the impact of ethanol on _Drosophila _geotaxis in wildtype and _[painless](https://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0060296.html)_ **or** [eag knockout](http://flybase.org/reports/FBal0003484.html). There is a description of this assay [here](https://www.jove.com/t/2504), in [this video](https://github.com/BrainFriedLab/virtualBehaviorCURE/blob/main/vCURE_NegativeGeotaxis.mov), and in [Nichols et al. (2012)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3671839/). See also [Bhandari et al. 2009](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19645731/).

#### Alcohol references in _painess_ or _Rutabaga _knockout flies_ _ü™∞ üç∏
In this experiment, you‚Äôll investigate consumption preferences in _[painless](https://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0060296.html)_ **or** [rutabaga knockouts](https://flybase.org/reports/FBal0032625.html) vs. wildtype flies ([Xu et al., 2012](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1601-183X.2012.00810.x); [Devineni et al. 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982209019423?via%3Dihub)). For this experiment, you‚Äôll have access to alcohol, sucrose, or peppermint essential oil.  One such procedure is described in [this video](https://github.com/BrainFriedLab/virtualBehaviorCURE/blob/main/vCURE_CAFE.mov) and [Devineni & Heberlein, 2009](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20005106/).

#### Spatial learning in Rutabaga knockout flies
Test to see if _Rutabaga _knockouts can learn about positions in space based on heat or olfactory clues (e.g. vinegar). See [Foucaud et al. 2010](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21151940/) & [Ofstad et al., 2011](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10131) for inspiration.

### **Earthworm**

#### Impact of environmental toxicant on earthworm nervous system

Test to see whether a common fungicide, Benomyl, changes the physiology of the earthworm. There‚Äôs an example of this experiment in [Drewes et al., 1987](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ps.2780190305) (see also [Drewes 1997](https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/37/4/346/305531)). You _do not _need to dissect the nerve cord for this experiment.

#### Demonstration of conduction rate facilitation in the earthworm üêõ üèÉ

Use the same preparation as our initial earthworm lab to test whether the conduction rate facilitates  ([Bullock, 1951](https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1113/jphysiol.1951.sp004605)).

#### Caffeinated earthworm muscles üêõ üí™

Modify our protocol to record from earthworm muscle ([Hidaka et al., 1969](https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/50/2/387/21398/Membrane-Properties-of-the-Somatic-Muscle)) and test the impact of caffeine (e.g. [Hidaka et al., 1969](https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/50/2/431/21406/The-Mechanical-Properties-of-the-Longitudinal)). 

#### The role of calcium in conduction velocity in earthworms üêõ ü•õ

Recording from a _dissected _nerve cord (see[ this video](https://youtu.be/8p-GAX4Xb2A), as well as [Gunther, 1976](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.901680405) or [1972](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0300962972904021)) and testing for changes in conduction velocity in response to:

* High Ca++ ringers (e.g., [Thiruketheeswaran et al., 2016](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00418-016-1463-2))  
* Lidocaine (e.g., [Fink & Cairns, 1984](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6696232/); [Dalkilic et al., 2015](https://bmcanesthesiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12871-015-0009-9))

### Leech

#### Diversity of mechanosensory cells in the leech üí´

Record from two or more _different_ cells & compare & contrast at least two metrics you record and measure from them.

#### The impact of Na+ and K+ concentration on Retzius cell physiology üßÇ

Record once again from the retzius cell, but also modify the Na+ and K+ concentrations (separately) to see how they impact the resting membrane potential and action potentials.

### Humans

#### Measuring brain states with EEG üß†

EEG block design experiment where you design 2-3 different conditions and look for differences in brain activity in specific frequency bands. In these experiments, you should be measuring a change in **brain state**, e.g. with meditation, concentration, environmental stimuli, etc. Many different projects are possible here!

:::{note}
If you decide to do an EEG experiment, you must:

* Conduct as many repeats of the stimulus/task as possible, with the time allotted.
* Collect and compare data from two different sets of electrodes (to record from two locations) from just **one **person in your group. In other words: fewer subjects, as many repeats as you can.
:::

#### Oddball stimuli with EEG

Explore whether you can find an event-related potential to an oddball stimulus, either with deviant sounds/audio [[Protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bu9GHxDhUiFMiCXnchw89medB50EQV6KrKJxNrfSqBk/edit?usp=sharing)]


### Cockroach

#### Sensory Evoked Responses in the Cockroach ü™≥ü¶æ

We didn‚Äôt work with cockroaches this quarter, but you can do extracellular recordings with them using a similar setup as the earthworm, stimulating the leg looking for sensory-evoked responses and then spike sorting this data. See [Ramos et al., 2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3592644/) for more information.

#### Olfactory Conditioning in the Cockroach ü™≥üëÉ

This experiment is designed to test whether cockroaches can be conditioned using olfactory cues. Check out these relevant papers for inspiration:

## Final Project FAQs

**What should we include in the methods of our presentation & lab report?** Your methods should give us an overview of the steps of your procedure. You _do not _need to tell us how you set up LabChart, which connections you used, etc. You _do _need to tell us what kind of recording you did (if applicable), how you experiment was set up, your experimental groups, and how you dealt with the data

**What if we don't get any data?** If you didn't get any data, you should put more emphasis on the introduction & methods for your experiment. You should also generate at least one hypothetical data figure, demonstrating what you were hoping to find. Your discussion should tell us why you think your experiment didn't work. *Keep in mind that not having data is not the same thing as having ‚Äúresults‚Äù ‚Äî even a null finding based on properly-collected data is a finding!*
