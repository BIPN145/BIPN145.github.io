# Working with LabChart Files

## Saving recordings from lab computers
After finishing your experiment, save the raw data (.adicht) file. I’d recommend using either Google Drive or Dropbox to save your data so that you may access it from anywhere. Your files will rarely be bigger than 5 MB.

## Viewing LabChart files from your Mac or PC

### LabChart Reader
If you’d like to view your files on your personal computer without LabChart 8, you can download [LabChart 8 Reader](https://www.adinstruments.com/products/labchart-reader). If you’re using LabChart Reader on PC, you can simply click & drag to select the data you’d like to export, copy, and then paste this into Excel. Unfortunately, LabChart Reader on Mac does not allow you to export your data.
