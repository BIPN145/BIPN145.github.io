### **Earthworm**

#### Impact of environmental toxicant on earthworm nervous system

Test to see whether a common fungicide, Benomyl, changes the physiology of the earthworm. There‚Äôs an example of this experiment in [Drewes et al., 1987](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ps.2780190305) (see also [Drewes 1997](https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/37/4/346/305531)). You _do not _need to dissect the nerve cord for this experiment.

#### Demonstration of conduction rate facilitation in the earthworm üêõ üèÉ

Use the same preparation as our initial earthworm lab to test whether the conduction rate facilitates  ([Bullock, 1951](https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1113/jphysiol.1951.sp004605)).

#### Caffeinated earthworm muscles üêõ üí™

Modify our protocol to record from earthworm muscle ([Hidaka et al., 1969](https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/50/2/387/21398/Membrane-Properties-of-the-Somatic-Muscle)) and test the impact of caffeine (e.g. [Hidaka et al., 1969](https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/50/2/431/21406/The-Mechanical-Properties-of-the-Longitudinal)). 

#### The role of calcium in conduction velocity in earthworms üêõ ü•õ

Recording from a _dissected _nerve cord (see[ this video](https://youtu.be/8p-GAX4Xb2A), as well as [Gunther, 1976](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.901680405) or [1972](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0300962972904021)) and testing for changes in conduction velocity in response to:

* High Ca++ ringers (e.g., [Thiruketheeswaran et al., 2016](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00418-016-1463-2))  
* Lidocaine (e.g., [Fink & Cairns, 1984](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6696232/); [Dalkilic et al., 2015](https://bmcanesthesiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12871-015-0009-9))

### **Leech**

#### Diversity of mechanosensory cells in the leech üí´

Record from two or more _different_ cells & compare & contrast at least two metrics you record and measure from them.

#### The impact of Na+ and K+ concentration on Retzius cell physiology üßÇ

Record once again from the retzius cell, but also modify the Na+ and K+ concentrations (separately) to see how they impact the resting membrane potential and action potentials.

---

### **Humans**

#### Measuring brain states with EEG üß†

EEG block design experiment where you design 2-3 different conditions and look for differences in brain activity in specific frequency bands. In these experiments, you should be measuring a change in **brain state**, e.g. with meditation, concentration, environmental stimuli, etc. Many different projects are possible here!

**Note**: If you decide to do an EEG experiment, you must:

* Conduct as many repeats of the stimulus/task as possible, with the time allotted.
* Collect and compare data from two different sets of electrodes (to record from two locations) from just **one **person in your group. In other words: fewer subjects, as many repeats as you can.


#### Oddball stimuli with EEG

Explore whether you can find an event-related potential to an oddball stimulus, either with deviant sounds/audio [[Protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bu9GHxDhUiFMiCXnchw89medB50EQV6KrKJxNrfSqBk/edit?usp=sharing)]

---

### **Cockroach**

#### Sensory Evoked Responses in the Cockroach ü™≥ü¶æ

We didn‚Äôt work with cockroaches this quarter, but you can do extracellular recordings with them using a similar setup as the earthworm, stimulating the leg looking for sensory-evoked responses and then spike sorting this data. See [Ramos et al., 2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3592644/) for more information.

#### Olfactory Conditioning in the Cockroach ü™≥üëÉ

This experiment is designed to test whether cockroaches can be conditioned using olfactory cues. Check out these relevant papers for inspiration:

#### Sample research proposal

**Adaption and Latency of T and P Cells in Leech Ganglia \
in Response to Prolonged and Intermittent Mechanical Stimulation**

**BACKGROUND**. A benefit of using the leech (‚Äã_Hirudo Medicinalis_‚Äã) as a neurological model is that it consists of discrete ganglia with a stereotyped arrangement of neurons. Of these neurons, the T and P cells are receptor neurons that are of interest to us. According to Pinato and Torre (2004), the T cell responds to touch and the P cell responds to pressure on the surface of the leech‚Äôs skin. When the skin is touched, an action potential is elicited in the T and P cells. Like Nicholls and Baylor (1968), we will examine the latency of each cell in response to touch, allowing us to compare how the T and P cells work to deliver input of external mechanical stimuli to the leech. Furthermore, as done by Van Essen (1973), we would also like to test the adaptation response of both cells by exposing them to prolonged constant stimulus and intermittent stimulus. ‚ÄãThe differing reaction times of T and P cells, and whether they undergo sensory adaptation may allow us to infer the relative complexity of leech‚Äôs sensory system, and whether sensory adaptation is a phenomenon prevalent across animal species.

**EXPERIMENTAL AIMS**

1. Investigate the adaptation of T and P cells in leech ganglia when the skin is stimulated with prolonged and intermittent touch.
2. Compare the action potentials and latency of T and P cells when exposing leech skin to a mechanical stimulus.

**METHODS**. We will prepare a single leech ganglion with skin approximately 3 body segments long attached to one side. The ganglion and body segment will be bathed in saline and examined beneath a stereo microscope. We will prepare two microelectrodes, one inserted into the T cell and the other into the P cell for intracellular recording. We will pull a glass electrode with approx. 1 mm tip to probe the skin. For prolonged touch, we will use a manipulator to lower the probe until it is in contact with the skin for 1 minute before retracting it. Simultaneously, we will record the action potentials elicited by the T and P cells. For intermittent probing, we will touch the leech skin, 1 second on and 1 second off, for a total of 1 minute while recording the action potentials from the T and P cells. There can be variability in the size of the probing electrode and leech skin size that may present difficulties in reproducing the experiment. There is also the difficulty of maneuvering the manipulator by hand to accurately and consistently probe the leech skin intermittently. 

**EXPECTED RESULTS**. We will view the action potentials elicited in both the T and P cells, identifying these cells from their resting potentials of approximately -40 mV (Titlow et al., 2013). We expect the T cell to respond quicker to all touch stimuli, and have a shorter latency than the P cell, characterized by the short time between the stimulus and the beginning of the action potential. Thus, we also expect to see the T cell adapt to the stimuli sooner than the P cell during prolonged stimulus. For the intermittent stimulus, we expect to see a large number of action potentials in both cells when they are first stimulated, which will reduce over time, indicating sensory adaptation. However, we hypothesize that there will be a quicker adaptation response in the P cell for intermittent stimulus because the T cell responds to touch and being able to quickly feel sensations on the skin seems more evolutionarily important than being able to sense changes in pressure.

## Project Presentations

On the final day of class, you‚Äôll present your results. Presentations should be no more than **10  minutes long**. These are group presentations, but the last two items on the rubric (verbal explanation & presentation) are graded individually.

## Final Project Lab Report
Final project lab reports are due at midnight on Wednesday of finals week. Your final project lab report should be a clear and concise summary of the experiment you conducted for the final project. Your report should be structured like our previous reports, but the way you present your data is entirely up to you. You should integrate feedback you received on your presentation into your final report. This is an _independent_ assignment but your **tables and/or figures **(and corresponding captions) may be shared between group members.


### Word count & formatting requirements
Your report should have every part of a full report: Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, and References. The word counts and reference requirements for Abstract, Introduction, and Discussion for [lab reports in BIPN 145](http://bit.ly/BIPN145_labreports) still apply. **In total, your report should not exceed 5 pages.**


### Methods
You do not need to restate any methods that are identical to the way that we conducted related experiments in lab. You should, however:
* Clearly identify any part of your procedure that deviated from the BIPN 145 lab protocols
* Describe, in detail, the parts of your experiment that were of your own design
* Cite any studies that directly inspired your experimental design

See the[ guide to writing lab reports](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1AiNsHHXBftfFuXHJjLvfbpXqOwNfvVhojTbWmkLlHYk/edit) for more information on what is necessary to include or not.


#### Presenting your results
You do not need to provide tables of your data in the lab report. Your lab report should be presented like a polished scientific publication. Most final lab reports will have about one methods figure, and three results figures. **You should not have more than five figures total.**

#### Reflection
As a part of your discussion, please include one paragraph that reflects on your experiment and what you would have done differently. How might this have changed the outcome of your experiment? As an example:
     \
_We should have used different/more worms because the data collected from one worm may be attributed to just that worm‚Äôs nature and because it would have been better to see if GABA really does affect MGF attributes by taking the variability between earthworms into account. We had enough time to repeat this experiment with another worm but opted not to to spend more time on data analysis; this was a judgment error of the whole group as it is always better to get quality data by conducting more trials. Collecting more data and reducing bias would have helped in developing more clear analysis on whether GABA truly impacts the earthworm MGF or not. Also, it might have been better to control for time (the order of just saline or GABA) in some way to more clearly distinguish between their effects. The last point of reflection here is that we might have used a lot more ethanol to anesthetize the worm than we needed to because we anesthetized the same earthworm more than once within one lab period. This might have tired out the earthworm faster, obscuring differences there might have been between the saline and GABA conditions._

## Final Project FAQs

**What should we include in the methods of our presentation & lab report?** Your methods should give us an overview of the steps of your procedure. You _do not _need to tell us how you set up LabChart, which connections you used, etc. You _do _need to tell us what kind of recording you did (if applicable), how you experiment was set up, your experimental groups, and how you dealt with the data

**What if we didn't get any data?** If you didn't get any data, you should put more emphasis on the introduction & methods for your experiment. You should also generate at least one hypothetical data figure, demonstrating what you were hoping to find. Your discussion should tell us why you think your experiment didn't work. *Keep in mind that not having data is not the same thing as having ‚Äúresults‚Äù ‚Äî even a null finding based on properly-collected data is a finding!*
